By wikipedia:

"The algorithm was often misattributed to John Carmack,
but in fact the code is based on an unpublished paper by William Kahan
and K.C. Ng circulated in May 1986.
The original constant was produced from a collaboration between Cleve Moler and Gregory Walsh,
while they worked for Ardent Computing in the late 1980s."
